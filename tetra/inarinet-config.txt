# Even with the performance-latency parameter set to 0 (low latency),
# LimeSDR seems to deliver samples in packets of 1024.
# Setting a smaller buffer size will cause samples to arrive
# in bursts of some 1024 samples.
# So, using a buffer smaller than that won't reduce RX latency much.
buffer 1024

# tx_latency should be at least 2 times, maybe about 4 times buffer size.
# 3 times it wasn't reliable for everyone with these settings,
# so let's try doubling it to 6 times the buffer size.
